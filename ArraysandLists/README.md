## Arrays

we can use arrays to store many variables of the same type such as int,string

number of elements in an array cannot be changed after initialization

## Single Dimensional Arrays

A single dimension arrays stores a collection of items of the same type , which are
accessible by an index


## MultiDimension Arrays
The arrays in the C# language do not need to have only one dimension. It is also possible to create two-dimensional or even three-dimensional arrays

## extension methods

They are methods that are added to a particular existing type (both built in and user defined )
and can be called in the same way if they are defined as instance methods.
The declaration of an extension method requires you to specify it within a static class
as a static method with the first parameter indicating the type, to which you want to "add"
this method, with the this keyword
